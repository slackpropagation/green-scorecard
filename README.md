## Project Overview

**Green Scorecard** is a CO₂ emissions dashboard that helps companies track their environmental footprint, compare site-level emissions to real-world benchmarks, and predict which facilities are at risk of missing their reduction targets.

This project uses real EPA FLIGHT data for benchmarking, simulates internal emissions across company sites, and applies machine learning to forecast compliance risk. It also includes a scenario simulator to visualize the impact of changes like increased output or renewable energy adoption.

---

## Key Features (Planned)

- ✅ Simulated internal CO₂ emissions data (scope 1, output, intensity)
- 📊 Benchmark comparison using EPA FLIGHT dataset
- ⚠️ Predictive risk model (logistic regression, decision tree) for next-quarter non-compliance
- 🔄 Scenario simulator: test impact of emissions changes, energy upgrades, or production shifts
- 📈 Visual dashboard with site-level trends, risk flags, and intensity benchmarks

---

## Why It Matters

- 🌍 **Sustainability:** Helps organizations visualize their ESG trajectory and align with global goals.
- ⚖️ **Compliance:** Surfaces risk *before* regulatory issues arise.
- 📣 **Transparency:** Provides clear, shareable insights for internal teams and external stakeholders.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn** – data simulation, modeling, and analysis  
- **Plotly**, **Streamlit** – dynamic dashboards and visualizations  
- **EPA FLIGHT dataset** – real-world benchmarking data  
- **YAML/CSV** – configuration and data inputs  
- **Docker (optional)** – reproducible development environment  

---

## Status

🚧 **Active Development** – This is the initial commit. Dashboard layout, data simulation scripts, and ML risk modeling pipeline are currently being scaffolded.  
The MVP will focus on CO₂ emissions tracking and forecasting before expanding to other ESG pillars.
