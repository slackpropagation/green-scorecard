## Project Overview

**Green Scorecard** is an interactive ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) analytics dashboard that helps companies track their sustainability progress and proactively identify compliance risks.

With new ESG regulations rapidly emerging, many organizations struggle to keep up. This project simulates internal ESG metrics—like emissions, board diversity, and energy efficiency—and visualizes progress against industry benchmarks. It also features a predictive risk model that flags potential non-compliance before it happens.

> Think of it as a real-time ESG cockpit—part analytics hub, part early warning system.

## Key Features (Planned)

- ✅ Simulated internal ESG metrics (CO₂ emissions, board composition, electricity usage, etc.)
- 📊 Interactive ESG scorecard by category (Environment, Social, Governance)
- ⚠️ Predictive “at-risk” flags using decision trees or logistic regression
- 🔄 Scenario tool: test what happens if metrics change (e.g., energy efficiency drops 5%)
- 📈 Visual storytelling to highlight risk areas, progress, and priorities

---

## Why It Matters

- 🌍 **Sustainability:** Helps organizations visualize their ESG trajectory and align with global goals.
- ⚖️ **Compliance:** Surfaces risk *before* regulatory issues arise.
- 📣 **Transparency:** Provides clear, shareable insights for internal teams and external stakeholders.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn** – data simulation and predictive modeling  
- **Plotly**, **Streamlit** – interactive data visualizations and UI  
- **YAML/JSON** – configurable ESG benchmarks  
- **Docker (optional)** – for reproducible deployment  

---

## Status

🚧 **Active Development** – This is the initial commit. Dashboard layout, data simulation scripts, and ML risk modeling pipeline are currently being scaffolded.
